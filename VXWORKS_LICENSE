If any legal action or proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of any alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the successful or prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled.  It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, breach of the provisions of this Agreement by You will cause Wind River irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Wind River shall therefore be entitled to obtain timely injunctive relief to protect Wind River's rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all remedies available at law.  Neither party shall be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder (except for the payment of money) on account of strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, material shortages or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable control of such party.   The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.    This Agreement may not be assigned, sub-licensed, or otherwise transferred (including by way of a merger) by You without Wind River's prior written consent. Wind River may assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in Wind River's sole discretion.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating any agency, employment relationship, partnership, principal-agent or other form of joint enterprise between the parties.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.  This Agreement constitutes the complete, final and exclusive statement of the agreement between Wind River and You, which supersedes all proposals, oral or written, and all other communications between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No waiver, alteration or modification of the provisions of this Agreement will be valid unless made in writing and signed by a corporate officer of Wind River.
